# Let's Play Hangman - The Sports Edition!

 

## Instructions how to play:

From the pieces of sports equipment pictured, review the number of missing letters to correctly guess the sport in question. Guess correctly and that letter is shown in the correct place on the word in question. Guess incorrectly and the incorrect letter is shown under the "Letters Already Guessed" location, prompting you to try again. If you are able to guess the sport word in question - watch the confetti fly!

### Approach Taken:

- I decided to go with a hangman game with a version of guessing the name of sports equipment in the shown picture. I started out drawing a wireframe to map out the screen design. I felt the game would be easy to understand by showing a picture of the equipment included with an underscore for the number of letters for the word in question. As each correct or incorrect letter is guessed, the letter would appear in the appropriate location. If the user guesses the incorrectly and uses all guesses remaining, they are presented a pop-up alert indicating their game is over. If the user guesses correctly, they get a shower of confetti on the screen!
